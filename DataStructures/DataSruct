Insertion order maitain in Array.  not the case with sets
Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays


Object vs maps

Objext are unordered whereas maps are ordered
Key in objects can only be string or symbol type whereas in maps, they can be of any type
object has an prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you're not careful.A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default
Object are not iterable . maps are iterable
The number of items in an Object must be detemined manually whereas readily available with the size property in a map
Apart from storing data, you can attach funtionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data.
